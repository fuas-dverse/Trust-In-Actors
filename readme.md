## The goal of the project

This projects is here so you can trust a bot made for DVerse or other bots that are coupled with DVerse.

This project also includes some bots that are being used or were used in the DVerse itself.  
Actual bots can be included in the main repository or separate from it.

## Actors

An actor can be a bot, a service, a person or a script.  
In this project the actor is mainly the bot and service that will be described.  
How the people interact with them will also be mentioned to the extend that it will be clear on how new people can make their own or how these bots work.
