The American mastodon caught the attention of not only European researchers but also influential Americans before and after the American Revolution. American historians of the 21st century have argued that findings and displays of its fossils had helped to bolster American nationalism and contributed to a greater understanding of extinctions.

However, the original genus name was overshadowed by \"Mastodon\" in the 19th century, which was established formally by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1817. The genus became problematic as it served as a wastebasket taxon for over 20 fossil proboscidean species whose dentitions more closely resembled that of M. americanum than those of elephantids or deinotheres up to the early 20th century.

In comparison to its likely ancestor Zygolophodon, Mammut is evolutionarily derived with a reduction to loss of the lower tusks, shortening of the mandibular symphysis, and particularly long and upward curving upper tusks. As a result of its conservative evolutionary history, Mammut consistently occupied specializations to browsing on leaves, fruits, and woody plants. This allowed mastodons to niche partition with other members of Proboscidea in North America, like gomphotheres and the Columbian mammoth, who had shifted to mixed feeding or grazing by the late Neogene-Quaternary. Mammut as a result was a highly successful proboscidean that had achieved maximum diversity in the Pliocene then is known from abundant fossil evidence in the Late Pleistocene. It is thought to have had behaviors not much different from elephants and mammoths, living in herds, displaying strong degrees of sexual dimorphism, and entering phases of aggression under musth in the case of males. Archeological evidence reveals that mastodons for at least a few thousand years coexisted with Paleoindians, who were the first humans to have dispersed to North America and at least sometimes hunted them based on kill sites found in both pre-Clovis and Clovis cultural phases."},"Paragraphs5":{"0":"Directe wereldwijde communicatie is te belangrijk om aan \u00e9\u00e9n bedrijf te laten toebehoren.

Eozygodon was subsequently succeeded by Zygolophodon by the early Miocene, and the latter dispersed into Eurasia by the late MN3 or MN4 of the Mammal Neogene zones (early Miocene) and into North America by the middle Miocene. The dispersal of mammutids between Africa and Eurasia may have occurred multiple times. The Mammutidae eventually went extinct from Africa prior to the late Miocene.8586"},"Paragraphs40":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":"Since many Mastodon instances are run by volunteers, some security experts are concerned about data security and responsiveness to new threats (like high-severity vulnerabilities) considering the difficulty of configuring and maintaining servers as well as uneven skill level among administrators.

The only definitively defined species of Zygolophodon from North America is Z. proavus, which occurs in the Barstovian and Clarendonian stages. M? furlongi from the Black Butte in Oregon also dates back to the Clarendonian stage, but the affinities of the species remains unclear. If it truly is a species of Mammut, then its earliest temporal range is recorded at about 10 Ma. The earliest undisputed appearance of Mammut is of M. nevadanum from Thousand Creek Beds, dating back to the early Hemphillian, or 8.0-7.1 Ma. Historically, North American paleontologists considered that North American Zygolophodon evolved into Mammut in an endemic fashion while European workers generally thought that Mammut was a Eurasian immigrant that replaced North American Zygolophodon during the Miocene or Pliocene. Current evidence supports an endemic radiation of North American mammutids because of the gradual appearance of Mammut morphologies and a lack of solid evidence that Mammut sensu stricto (in a strict sense) ever dispersed outside of North America.47"}}
